# Minimum Operations

Exercise to practice for interviews

## Context

### 0. Minimum Operations

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

* Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
* Returns an integer
* If `n` is impossible to achieve, return 0

```
$ cat 0-main.py

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
